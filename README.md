# Antenna-Pattern-Analysis-
This project i've done under the guidance of Professor APN rao.

Introduction :
Antenna Pattern Analysis is necessary to design the radiation pattern of an antenna for a specific application. In this project I've developed a program in matlab which displays the 3d antenna radiation pattern, the corresponding universal pattern and the xy, yz, zx cross sections of the 3d pattern for a set of parameters, for a UNIFORM LINEAR ARRAY, such as the number of ISOTROPIC elements (n), the distance between the elements (d) and the successive excitation phase difference between them which are controlled by the user.
